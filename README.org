** mjstarter

A Leiningen template that sets up a workflow for figwheel and weasel with as
least as effort as possible. 
   
Create a new app from the template:
: lein new mjstarter foobar

Start the figwheel and nrepl server:
: cd foobar
: lein cooper

Give it a minute.

Add the following function to Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC 
(defun mjstarter ()
  "Cider-connect to localhost:52123 and start weasel repl"
  (interactive)
  (cider-connect "localhost" 52123)
  (cider-insert-in-repl "(require 'mjstarter.core) (mjstarter.core/weasel)" t))
#+END_SRC 

Start the cljs repl.
: M-x mjstarter

Navigate in a browser to http://localhost:2449/index.html

Edit the cljs files in src-cljs and the css files in resources/public. Browser updates without refreshing.

To adapt the template, first clone the repo:
: git clone git:asdfas

Edit =src/leiningen/new/mjstarter.clj= . There are some settings in there for host and port settings for weasel, figwheel and the nrepl server.
