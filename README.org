* mjstarter

A Leiningen template that sets up a workflow for figwheel and weasel with the
least of effort as possible. 

** Usage
   
Create a new app from the template:
: lein new mjstarter foobar

Start the figwheel and nrepl server:
: cd foobar
: lein cooper

Give it a minute.

Add the following function to Emacs:
#+BEGIN_SRC elisp
(defun mjstarter ()
  "Cider-connect to localhost:52123 and start weasel repl"
  (interactive)
  (cider-connect "localhost" 52123)
  (cider-insert-in-repl "(require 'mjstarter.core) (mjstarter.core/weasel)" t))
#+END_SRC 

Start the cljs repl.
: M-x mjstarter

Navigate in a browser to http://localhost:2449/index.html

Edit the cljs files in src-cljs and the css files in resources/public. Browser
updates without refreshing.

** Editing the template
   
For more info on creating leiningen templates see [[https://github.com/Raynes/lein-newnew][here]] .

To adapt the template, first clone the repo:
: git clone git@github.com:Michieljoris/mjstarter.git

Edit =src/leiningen/new/mjstarter.clj= . There are some settings in there for host and port settings for weasel, figwheel and the nrepl server, and of course the rest of the configuration for the template.

The files that make up the instantiated project are in =resources/leiningen/new/mjstarter=.

To add/update the modified template in the local leiningen repository:
: lein install

To push to clojars.org:
: lein deploy

But this will push to my account at clojars.org.

To make a new template:
: lein new template template-name

Then adapt it, possibly copying from this template.

Don't forget to add to ~/.lein/profiles.clj:
: [mjstarter/lein-template "0.1.0-SNAPSHOT"]
